<h2>Obtaining the Project</h2>
<p>For Project 2 you will be working with an Elevator Simulator. Below is an 
illustration of the Elevator Simulator:</p>
<p class="auto-style5">.<img alt="Elevator Simulator" height="692" src="./CSE 251 Project 2_ Elevator Simulator_files/Screenshot-Elevator Simulator.png" width="437"></p>
<p>It will be your responsibility to write the control software for the 
elevator. You need to control the motor, brakes, and doors. This is an example 
of a <em>controls application</em>, where you will be responsible for making a hardware 
system work correctly through code you write.</p>
<div class="shadowboxcenter"><div class="shadowcontentorange">
	Control systems like this control real-world system with real-world people 
	involved. If your code does not work correctly, you may kill someone or even 
	burn the building down. </div></div>
<p>This project must be compiled and executed on a machine with an X-Server and 
wxWidgets. This is true for the Linux lab machines. I make no guarantee about 
personal machines and it is unlikely that you can work on this project remotely 
given the animation it uses. It is best to work on this project in the lab.</p>
<p>First, create a directory named project2 in your Linux account. Remember, you 
use the mkdir command to create a directory. You can put this under cse251 or 
under the root directory, wherever you want to put it. Then download the file
<a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse251/project2/Elevator.tar.gz">Elevator.tar.gz</a> into that directory. You 
can right click on the link in the browser and choose Save Link As... to save 
the file.</p>
<p>Then, using a terminal window in the directory where you put 
<a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse251/project2/Elevator.tar.gz">Elevator.tar.gz</a>, 
do this command:</p>
<pre class="code">tar xvzf Elevator.tar.gz</pre>
<p>This will create a directory called Elevator. Change into that directory 
using cd.</p>
<h2>Compiling and Running the Project</h2>
<p>This project uses a make file to automate the building process. Thus, we do 
not use the gcc command directly. Instead, we use a Makefile to automate the 
process. Since some of the machines we use are still 32-bit machines, and 
others (namely the remote CSE machines arctic, pacific, black, etc) are 64-bit 
machines, there are two different commands that can be used to compile the 
project,
</p><pre class="code">make elevator32</pre>
builds the 32-bit version of the code (this should be used in the lab, and 
possibly on personal computers), while
<pre class="code">make elevator64</pre>
builds the 64-bit version of the code (this should be used on the remote 
logon machine and possibly on personal computers).
<p>You should see output something like this:</p>
<pre class="code">cbowen@ubuntu:~/test2/Elevator$ make
gcc -c -o elevator.o elevator.c
g++ -o elevator elevator.o -lm libElevatorLib.a `wx-config --libs`</pre>
<p>If your output does not look like this, look at the error messages. If the
compiler is complaining about i686 or i386 code, then you are trying the 32-bit
build on a 64-bit machine. If you get a significant amount of gibberish, then you
are trying the 64-bit build on a 32-bit machine. As always, reading the error 
messages is helpful.</p>
<p>If you get an error about elevator.o being of the wrong type, run
</p><pre class="code">make clean</pre>
which will remove any old compiled files that may be around when you switch
machines. Also, running 
<pre class="code">make</pre>
with no arguments prints a summary of these commands for you<p></p>
<p>This is building your application for you. Whenever you need to recompile, 
just type: "make elevator32" or "make elevator64". We will 
be covering make files later.</p>
<p>To run the program for the first time, type:</p>
<pre class="code">./elevator</pre>
<p>The program should display the elevator simulator. It will not be functional, 
because you have not written the code to make it functional, yet. You can exit 
the program by clicking the box with an X to close the window. </p>
<p>In the simulator there is one elevator. The section of the window with doors 
is the elevator doors for each of the three floors. To the right of the doors 
are the call buttons that call the elevator to that floor. A passenger presses 
the up button to indicate they want to ride the elevator up.</p>
<p>To the left of the doors we see the elevator in its shaft. There is only one 
elevator. This is the same elevator as the one you will see behind the doors. It 
is drawn twice so we can see both how it looks to users and what is going on 
inside the elevator shaft.</p>
<p>To the left of the elevator is the panel inside the elevator car. This is 
where you can press buttons to choose a floor to go do. There are also buttons 
to open and close the doors. The panel moves with the elevator car.</p>
<p>Above the elevator panel are two meters that indicate the speed of the 
elevator and the temperature of the motor. The speed meter has a green area. You 
can only apply the brake to stop the elevator if the speed is in this area (up 
to 0.33 meters per second). The red area indicates speeds too fast for the elevator 
design. Allowing the speed to go into the red area means your elevator is going 
too fast and may break.</p>
<p>The temperature meter tells the current temperature of the motor. The 
elevator is controlled by a DC motor. As you use it, it will heat up. If you put 
too much work on the motor it will get so hot it may catch file. Temperatures 
in the red zone indicate the motor is overheating and may burn your building 
down.</p>
<p>You can see the motor room in the small window above the elevator shaft.</p>
<div class="shadowboxcenter"><div class="shadowcontentgrayblue">
	There may occasionally be some jerkiness to the animation in the Elevator 
	Simulator. This is mostly due to scheduling in the Linux operating system 
	and is likely not the fault of your program.</div></div>
<h2>Reference Solution</h2>
<p>There is an example solution for the project included in executable form. If 
you run the program <em>elevator-solution</em> (<em>elevator-solution-64</em> on 64-bit machines), you can see how it is supposed to work 
when the entire project (Parts A and B) is complete. Run the reference solution 
with the command:</p>
<pre class="code">./elevator-solution</pre>
<p>Please let me know if you find any bugs in the reference solution.</p>
<h2>Some Exercises To Get Started</h2>
<p>All of the code you write for this project will be contained in the file 
<strong>elevator.c</strong>. I have provided an initial version of this file to get you started. 
The initial version is:</p>
<pre class="code">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

#include "ElevatorLib.h"

/*
 * Name :        &lt;insert name here&gt;
 * Description : Project 2 - The elevator controller
 */

/*
 * Name :        main()
 * Description : Program entry point.
 */
int main()
{
    /*
     * This call starts the elevator system running
     */
    printf("Elevator Startup\n");
    ElevatorStartup();

    /*
     * This loop runs until we shut the elevator system down
     * by closing the window it runs in.
     */
    while(IsElevatorRunning())
    {

    }

    /*
     * This call shuts down the elevator system
     */
    printf("Elevator Shutdown\n");
    ElevatorShutdown();
    return 0;
}</pre>
<p>Please read the comments to tell what the functions all do in this code. 
Complete <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse251/project2/doc/html/index.html">documentation</a> for all of the 
functions available to use in the Elevator Simulator are available in the
<a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse251/project2.html#Resources">Resources section</a>. </p>
<p>This program uses a <em>control loop</em>.&nbsp; This is a continuous loop 
that runs as long as your system is active. In the program above the control 
loop is this:</p>
<pre class="code">    /*
     * This loop runs until we shut the elevator system down
     * by closing the window it runs in.
     */
    while(IsElevatorRunning())
    {

    }</pre>
<p>This loop runs at a rate of 1000 iterations per second. So, every time the 
body of the loop executes, 0.001 seconds have elapsed.</p>
<div class="shadowboxcenter"><div class="shadowcontentorange">
	Do not put code in the main function before the call to ElevatorStartup or 
	after the call to ElevatorShutdown. The simulation does not exist before 
	started or after shutdown.&nbsp; </div></div>
<h3>Turning Off the Brake</h3>
<p>&nbsp;When you start the simulation, the elevator motor power is set to zero 
and the brake is on. The means the elevator stays on the first floor. To turn 
off the brake, we use the SetBrake function. Add this line of code before the 
control loop:</p>
<pre class="code">    SetBrake(false);</pre>
<p>
<img alt="Run icon" class="style3" height="32" src="./CSE 251 Project 2_ Elevator Simulator_files/runicon.jpg" width="32"> 
Compile and run the program (remember, type "make" to compile). You may be 
surprised to see that the elevator goes up. Elevators have
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterweight">counterweights</a>. When 
the elevator goes up, the counterweight goes down. To be efficient, the 
counterweight weights the same as the car plus some average number of 
passengers. The car masses 453 kilograms. The counterweight is 679 kilograms. 
So, with no brake the car goes up. </p>
<p>The simulator has the ability to change the number of passengers randomly (up 
to 3). Add this line of code right after the SetBrake call:</p>
<pre class="code">    ChangeLoading();</pre>
<p>
<img alt="Run icon" class="style3" height="32" src="./CSE 251 Project 2_ Elevator Simulator_files/runicon.jpg" width="32"> 
Now, each time you run the program you will get a different loading. Try several 
runs to see what happens with different numbers of passengers. It's a good idea 
to leave this call in so you can test with different passenger loads.</p>
<p>
You can also use this call to put the maximum load in the elevator (3 
passengers):</p>
<pre class="code">    SetLoading(7);</pre>
<h3>Turning On the Motor</h3>
<p>Now add this line of code right after the SetBreak call to turn on the motor 
with maximum power in the up direction:</p>
<pre class="code">    SetMotorPower(1);</pre>
<p>
<img alt="Run icon" class="style3" height="32" src="./CSE 251 Project 2_ Elevator Simulator_files/runicon.jpg" width="32"> 
When you run this you will see that the speed is off the scale. We're clearly 
running the elevator too fast. When the elevator gets to the top, it can't 
go anywhere, so it stops. The motor is then stalled. It quickly heats up and 
eventually catches on fire. Note that the same thing will happen if you start 
the motor with the brake on. </p>
<h3>Going Up and Going Down</h3>
<p>Generally elevators travel up until they have serviced all passengers in that 
direction, then they go down. We are going to add some code to handle this 
decision. Add this variable to the main function:</p>
<pre class="code">    bool goingUp = true;</pre>
<p>Now, put this code inside the control loop:</p>
<pre class="code">        if(goingUp &amp;&amp; GetFloor() &gt; 3)
        {
            /* We are above the third floor. Reverse direction */
            goingUp = false;
            SetMotorPower(-1);
            ChangeLoading();
        }</pre>
<p>
<img alt="Run icon" class="style3" height="32" src="./CSE 251 Project 2_ Elevator Simulator_files/runicon.jpg" width="32"> 
This will go to the top of the shaft and then go back down. It will then get 
stuck, of course. I'll let you add the code for the other direction so the 
elevator goes back and forth. You need to start looking in the 
<a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse251/project2/doc/html/index.html">documentation for ElevatorLib</a> to understand what each of the functions do and find functions that 
do what you need to do for the project. </p>
<p>I added the call to change the loading so we can tell what the elevator does 
with different loadings. This will be useful for Part A of the project.</p>
<div class="shadowboxcenter"><div class="shadowcontentgrayblue">
	Why do we test for goingUp and GetFloor() &gt; 3? Try changing the test to 
	this:<br>
	<pre class="code">       if(GetFloor() &gt; 3)</pre>Do you understand what it is doing different? Remember: a) the control loop 
	runs continuously and b) the elevator does not instantly change direction 
	when we change the motor power. It has mass and has to be deccelerated to 
	zero and accelerated in the other direction.<br>
	<br>
	After you have seen what this does, restore the line to what it was before:<br>
	<pre class="code">        if(goingUp &amp;&amp; GetFloor() &gt; 3)</pre>
	</div></div>
